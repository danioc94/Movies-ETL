# Movies-ETL
This repository includes code that can be used to Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle. It includes Python code to create clean Pandas dataframes for each one of the sources and further merge them so it can then be loaded onto PostgreSQL for DB analysis.
